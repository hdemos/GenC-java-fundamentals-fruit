### Comments
Make sure to use descriptive comments in your code.
Java uses two forward slashes __//__ to note any comments in a .java file. 
A good programmer uses comments useful for those unfamiler with their code. Rather than commenting //refers to 2nd way to calculate x,
a better comment might be //this method calculates the area of a sphere .
