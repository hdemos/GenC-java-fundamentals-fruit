Multiple Code Explorations for Java Fundamentals

## Exercise Objectives
* Create a proper variable name, leveraging the variable naming rules
* Use descriptive comments while creating the fruit class.
* Identify which words are java keywords

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone & open in your IDE
3. Work off the appropriate branch, 01-exercise branch is the first exercise

Use W3 Schools, Java Docs and your colleges to work through these exercises. Remember, it is important to code on your own computer as you will be tested on the concepts and use these or similar cocepts in your project.

### Comments
Make sure to use descriptive comments in your code.
Java uses two forward slashes __//__ to note any comments in a .java file. 
A good programmer uses comments useful for those unfamiler with their code. Rather than commenting //refers to 2nd way to calculate x,
a better comment might be //this method calculates the area of a sphere . 

### Classes & Methods
Read about classes and methods. 
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_syntax.htm

You should now understand classes and methods and how to write them. You should also understand how to use java keywords to declare and initialize a primitive variable. 

1. Create a java class named Apple.java that has a method named appleColor. The method appleColor() returns a String. 
2. Declare and initialize a variable myColor with the Data Type of String and value of Red. 
3. Create a main method inside Apple.java that calls appleColor() and prints out the value.


### Exercise 02
If you don't remember what a primitive data type is, review it first
